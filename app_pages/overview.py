        **Why Are Emissions Important?**
        
        - **Climate Change:** GHGs trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.
        - **Air Pollution & Health Risks:** Pollutants can cause respiratory issues, heart diseases, and other health problems.
        - **Environmental Impact:** Emissions lead to phenomena such as acid rain, ocean acidification, and ecosystem disruption.
        - **Mitigation Efforts:** Strategies like renewable energy adoption, energy efficiency, carbon capture, and policy initiatives (e.g., the Paris Agreement) are key to reducing emissions.
